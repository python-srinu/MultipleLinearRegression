## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, the Python libraries Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn are required.

### Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/python-srinu/MultipleLinearRegression.git

# Dataset

The dataset (`2017_2020_bmi.csv`) includes information on height, weight, and BMI, covering multiple years. It serves as a foundation for exploring relationships between these variables and building a predictive model for weight. Key features are:

- **yr**: Collection year
- **height**: Height of individuals (in cm)
- **weight**: Weight of individuals (in kg)
- **bmi**: Body Mass Index (a derived measurement of body fat)

# EDA and Visualization

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps to understand data distributions, detect outliers, and analyze relationships among variables. Key visualization techniques include:

- **Histograms**: To show the frequency distribution of variables
- **Box plots**: To detect outliers in height, weight, and BMI
- **Pair plots and correlation matrices**: To examine relationships between height, BMI, and weight

These steps reveal underlying data patterns and inform preprocessing needs.

# Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance. In this case, polynomial features are introduced to capture non-linear relationships between height, BMI, and weight. This transformation enhances the model’s ability to learn complex patterns without significantly increasing its complexity.

# Model Training and Evaluation

The project uses Ridge and Lasso regression models, which are forms of linear regression with added regularization:

- **Ridge Regression** (L2 regularization) minimizes overfitting by reducing the size of coefficients.
- **Lasso Regression** (L1 regularization) performs feature selection by setting some coefficients to zero, thus simplifying the model.

Cross-validation is used to evaluate model performance on different data subsets, helping to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Evaluation metrics include **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R^2 score**.

# Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning is conducted using GridSearchCV to find the optimal regularization parameter (`alpha`) for both Ridge and Lasso regression models:

- **GridSearchCV** automates the search for the best alpha value.
- **Alpha values** impact regularization strength, with smaller values applying less penalty and larger values applying more.

This optimization step refines the model’s predictive power by minimizing overfitting.

# Model Evaluation

The Ridge and Lasso models, optimized through cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, are evaluated on a test set. Key metrics used are:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: A measure of the average squared difference between predicted and actual values, with lower values indicating better performance.
- **R^2 Score**: Represents the proportion of variance explained by the model, with values closer to 1 indicating a stronger fit.

Comparing Ridge and Lasso models enables an understanding of which approach better captures the relationship between the variables.

# Residual Analysis

Residual analysis is performed to check for patterns or violations of assumptions in the model residuals (differences between actual and predicted values):

- **Residual distribution**: Ideally, residuals should follow a normal distribution, indicating a well-fitting model.
- **Residuals vs. Predicted Values**: Scatter plots of residuals against predicted values help identify any systematic errors or model limitations.

Residual analysis provides additional insights into model performance and highlights areas where improvements might be possible.

# Results and Insights

Ridge regression generally outperformed Lasso, suggesting that all features contribute meaningfully to predicting weight without the need for significant sparsity. Polynomial features successfully captured non-linear relationships, while hyperparameter tuning further refined the model.

### Key Takeaways:
- Regularization techniques like Ridge and Lasso control model complexity effectively.
- Polynomial transformations are helpful in capturing complex, non-linear relationships.
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are essential for building robust predictive models.

# Future Work

Potential future directions for this project include:

- **Testing additional models**: Models like Random Forest or Support Vector Machines (SVM) could provide alternative insights and potential improvements.
- **Exploring other feature transformations**: Log transformations or interaction terms may capture different aspects of the data.
- **Deploying the model as an application**: Integrate the model with a web framework such as Flask or FastAPI to enable real-time predictions.
